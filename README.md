# Leetcode problem solutions

(probably incorrect for the most part)

I am not planning to log in there. I used to not need to login there.
Now, I guess, I do to try out more than 1 test.

I could make my own tests, but I prefer to do that there thingy for real projects...

*Plus, may not be finished*

*Plus plus, I don't necessarily plan to continue doing Leetcode problems, maybe a bit before the obvious*
